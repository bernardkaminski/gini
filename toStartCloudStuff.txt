Create an AWS account, and obtain a AWS key and AWS Secret key
git clone https://github.com/bernardkaminski/gini.git
cd gini/
git checkout Cloud // Switch to the cloud branch
export GINI_HOME=<where you want to put the .gini folder of metadata>  // Bunch of files that allow the backend and frontend to communicate 
export GINI_ROOT=<path to the repo you just cloned>
echo "AWS_KEY = <your AWS key>" >> keys.py   // Note this keys.py should be in the gini dir you cloned
echo "AWS_SECRET = <your AWS secret key>" >> keys.py
scons install
bin/gbuilder
Inside the GUI that opens, click on the open icon, then select AmazonTest.gsav
Click the green play button
Wait 1-2 minutes for the cloud instance to get running

Notes:
- Make sure you kill the network with the red stop button, otherwise the instances may not be killed on the cloud
and you would have to login to the AWS console to kill them
- The xterm for the cloud icon opens automatically, and after you kill the network make sure you close that xterm manually
(the red stop button does not kill that xterm), otherwise the tcp tunnel will have one endpoint open and likely will print a lot of stuff and slow down your computer
