Create an AWS account, and obtain a AWS key and AWS Secret key
git clone https://github.com/bernardkaminski/gini.git
Open .bashrc in your favourite editor
At top of file, add line: export GINI_HOME=$HOME/gini
On next line, add: export PATH=$PATH:$GINI_HOME/bin
Save and close .bashrc
source .bashrc
cd gini/
git checkout Cloud // Switch to the cloud branch
echo "AWS_KEY = \"<your AWS access key ID>\"" >> keys.py   // slashes and quotation marks included
echo "AWS_SECRET = \"<your AWS secret key>\"" >> keys.py	// Note this keys.py should be in the gini dir you cloned
scons install
bin/gbuilder
Inside the GUI that opens, click on the open icon, then select AmazonTest.gsav from the gini directory
Click the green play button
Wait 1-2 minutes for the cloud instance to get running

Notes:
- Make sure you kill the network with the red stop button, otherwise the instances may not be killed on the cloud
and you would have to login to the AWS console to kill them
- The xterm for the cloud icon opens automatically, and after you kill the network make sure you close that xterm manually
(the red stop button does not kill that xterm), otherwise the tcp tunnel will have one endpoint open and likely will print a lot of stuff and slow down your computer
